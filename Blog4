# User Management 

**Users** 

The ESG Tracker system defines two primary user categories:Guest Users and Registered Users. 
**Guest Users** are Nilfisk employees who access the platform without logging in. 
They have limited functionality, such as only viewing general ESG KPI's or the about page shared by the organization. 
**Registered Users** include admin who must log in to access their features. The admin has access to the "Add / Edit Data page", 
where the admin can either; edit, add or edit data in the different tables.
