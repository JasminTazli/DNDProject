When "Gas Emissions" is clicked the user gets an overview of the date, the exact gas emission, a summary of "is it good or bad" and a recommendation to what the company can do in order to either improve or if they are on the right track.

The key requirement that was fulfilled with this web application is 

*"As a manager, I want to access a user-friendly dashboard in Blazor where I can see ESG key metrics over time and receive recommendations for improvements, 
so I can better meet ESG standards and requirements."*

This requirement is fulfilled becase the user gets an overview of the environmental data. 
However, at current time there is space for improvement to make it more user-friendly.
