# 1 Project Formulation & Initial Requirements
**Description of the Problem Domain and Why We Chose It:**

In recent years, the increasing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues has pushed companies to rethink how they manage their impact on the world. However, many organizations struggle to monitor and improve their ESG performance effectively. This challenge often arises due to the complexity of collecting and analyzing relevant data, and the lack of clear frameworks for ESG reporting and improvement. Recognizing these challenges, we chose to develop an ESG Compliance Monitor to address this issue.
As a team, we are passionate about environmental sustainability and social responsibility, and we believe that by creating a tool to help companies improve their ESG performance, we can contribute to a broader positive impact. The ESG Compliance Monitor offers an easy-to-use platform for businesses to track key ESG metrics, ensure compliance with regulations, and improve their overall sustainability profile. By leveraging established standards like GRI and ISO 26000, companies can measure their progress and make informed decisions about their ESG strategies. Through this solution, we aim to help companies in reducing their environmental footprint, leading to a more sustainable and equitable business environment.

**User Stories**
- As a developer, I want the RESTful web service to handle HTTP requests efficiently, so the ESG data can be reliably collected and updated from multiple internal systems via API endpoints.
  
- As a developer, I want to integrate SQLite with an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), so the system can store and retrieve ESG data persistently while ensuring easy interaction between the database and business logic.

- As a front-end developer, I want to build the dashboard using Blazor, so I can create a fast and interactive user interface that communicates with the back-end via HTTP.

- As a system administrator, I want to implement role-based access control within the login functionality, so different user roles (e.g., administrators, auditors, employees) can have tailored permissions to ensure data security and access only to relevant ESG data.

- As a database administrator, I want the system to log all data transactions related to ESG metrics (create, read, update, delete) in the SQLite database, so I can audit changes and ensure data integrity.
