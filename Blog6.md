# Product Conclusion & Demonstration


We have completed our ESG tracking application, and the system works as expected. We are pleased with the outcome. 
The application includes pages that display Nilfisk's ESG data in tables, providing a clear and accessible overview. 
Additionally, there is a login feature that allows the admin to log in. Once logged in, the admin has access to an "Add / Edit Data" page where they can update, add, or delete entries in the tables.

We have met all the technical requirements. 
The system includes a RESTful web service, the frontend is built with Blazor, and communication between the web service and the web application is managed via HTTP requests. 
Furthermore, the system includes login functionality, and data is stored using an ORM and SQLite.

**Requirements** 
At the start of the project we made some requirements but after working further with the application and going furhter into the process 
we realized that we needed to change our requirements as they were not specific nor relevant for the application. The finalized requirements are therefore as follows: 

<em>
- As a user, I want to view Nilfiskâ€™s environmental KPIs to enhance sustainability and share progress with customers.
- As an admin, I want a secure login to access all relevant data.
- As an admin, I want to add data to keep sustainability metrics accurate and up-to-date for reporting.
- As a user, I want an "About" page to learn about the ESG report and understand Nilfisk's sustainability initiatives and reporting methods.<em>

And all of these requirements have been met.
