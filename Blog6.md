# Product Conclusion & Demonstration


We have completed our ESG tracking application, and the system works as expected. We are pleased with the outcome. 
The application includes pages that display Nilfisk's ESG data in tables, providing a clear and accessible overview. 
Additionally, there is a login feature that allows the admin to log in. Once logged in, the admin has access to an "Add / Edit Data" page where they can update, add, or delete entries in the tables.

We have adhered to all technical requirements. 
The system includes a RESTful web service, the frontend is built with Blazor, and communication between the web service and the web application is managed via HTTP requests. 
Furthermore, the system includes login functionality, and data is stored using an ORM and SQLite.
