# 1 Project Formulation & Initial Requirements
**Description of the Problem Domain and Why We Chose It:**

In recent years, the increasing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues has pushed companies to rethink how they manage their impact on the world. 
However, many organizations struggle to monitor and improve their ESG performance effectively. 
This challenge often arises due to the complexity of collecting and analyzing relevant data, and the lack of clear frameworks for ESG reporting and improvement. 
Recognizing these challenges, we chose to develop an ESG Compliance Monitor to address this issue.

As a team, we are passionate about environmental sustainability and social responsibility, and we believe that by creating a tool to help companies improve their ESG performance, we can contribute to a broader positive impact. 
The ESG Compliance Monitor offers an easy-to-use platform for businesses to track key ESG metrics, ensure compliance with regulations, and improve their overall sustainability profile. 
By leveraging established standards like GRI and ISO 26000, companies can measure their progress and make informed decisions about their ESG strategies. 
Through this solution, we aim to help companies in reducing their environmental footprint, leading to a more sustainable and equitable business environment.

Our idea is therefore - ESG Compliance Monitor
A web application that helps companies monitor and improve their ESG efforts. It should include:
RESTful Webservice: Handling of data collection from internal systems (e.g., calculating the environmental impact of their products).
Login Functionality: Different roles (administrator, employee, etc.), which can log in and access relevant data.
The administrator should be able to enter/update data that will be visible in the system.
Frontend in Blazor: An interactive web application that provides a user-friendly dashboard solution, where management, for example, can view ESG key metrics over time and receive recommendations for improvements based on requirements and ESG standards.

**User Stories**

RESTful Webservice for data collection:
As a company, I want to connect my internal systems to a RESTful Webservice so that I can collect data on the environmental impact of my products and other ESG-related metrics.

Login with roles:
As a user, I want to log in to the system with my credentials so that I can access data based on my role (e.g., administrator or employee).

Administrator data management:
As an administrator, I want to enter and update ESG data in the system so that all relevant users can see the latest information and changes.

Blazor frontend with dashboard:
As a manager, I want to access a user-friendly dashboard in Blazor where I can see ESG key metrics over time and receive recommendations for improvements, so I can better meet ESG standards and requirements.
